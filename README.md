# 💰Secret Money💰

A crypto 💵 tracker app. 💥 [Download](https://github.com/s-r-aman/secret-money/raw/master/secret-money.apk) 💥for android.

This is my first react native project🤟🤟.

I made this app through this incredible article by [Indrek Lasn](https://medium.com/@wesharehoodies) 🙏 on [Medium](https://medium.com/)-

1.  [Lesson 1](https://medium.com/react-native-training/bitcoin-ripple-ethereum-price-checker-with-react-native-redux-e9d076037092).
2.  [Lesson 2](https://medium.com/react-native-training/tutorial-react-native-redux-native-mobile-app-for-tracking-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-litecoin-810850cf8acc).
3.  [Lesson 3](https://medium.com/react-native-training/learn-how-to-build-a-rn-redux-cryptocurrency-app-chapter-iii-a454dda156b).
4.  [Lesson 4](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-how-to-build-a-rn-redux-cryptocurrency-app-chapter-iv-b0e0c5ca2dca).

And added some features that I thought would be cooler to have.

I'm using [Coin Market Cap's](ttps://coinmarketcap.com) API. [Read the Docs](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).

I will provide a download link as soon as I build the IOS app.
