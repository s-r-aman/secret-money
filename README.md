# Secret Money

A crypto currency tracker app. Currently in development.

This is my first react native project.

I made this app through this incredible article by [Indrek Lasn](https://medium.com/@wesharehoodies) on [Medium](https://medium.com/)-

4.  [Lesson 4](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-how-to-build-a-rn-redux-cryptocurrency-app-chapter-iv-b0e0c5ca2dca).

I'm using [Coin Market Cap's](ttps://coinmarketcap.com) API. [Read the Docs](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/).

I will provide a download link as soon as I build the Android and IOS app.
